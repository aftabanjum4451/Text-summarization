# Text summarization
Text summarization is the technique for generating a concise and precise summary of voluminous texts while focusing on the sections that convey useful information, and without losing the overall meaning.
Automatic text summarization aims to transform lengthy documents into shortened versions, something which could be difficult and costly to undertake if done manually.

# Extraction-based summarization
In extraction-based summarization, a subset of words that represent the most important points is pulled from a piece of text and combined to make a summary.
